## 🧬 Introduction to Sequence Reads in FASTQ Format

The **FASTQ** format is a standard text-based file format used to store both **biological sequence data** (usually DNA or RNA reads) and their corresponding **quality scores** generated by high-throughput sequencing platforms such as Illumina. Each read in a FASTQ file is represented by **four lines**:

1. **Header line** — begins with `@`, followed by a sequence identifier and optional description.  
2. **Sequence line** — contains the raw nucleotide sequence (e.g., A, T, G, C, or N).  
3. **Separator line** — begins with a `+` symbol, and may optionally repeat the identifier from the header.  
4. **Quality score line** — encodes the quality of each base in the sequence, using ASCII characters that represent Phred quality scores.

Each set of four lines corresponds to one read. The quality scores are crucial for downstream analyses because they indicate the confidence of each base call.

**Example:**
@SEQ_ID
GATTACA
+
IIIIIII

Here:
- `@SEQ_ID` is the identifier of the sequence read.  
- `GATTACA` is the nucleotide sequence.  
- `IIIIIII` represents the quality scores, where each “I” encodes a high Phred score (indicating high confidence).


## 🧬 Base Qualities in FASTQ Files

In FASTQ files, **base quality scores** represent the confidence that a base (A, T, G, or C) has been correctly identified by the sequencing machine.  
These scores are typically encoded using the **Phred+33** ASCII scheme.

### 🔢 ASCII Encoding: "Phred+33"

To store quality scores efficiently as text:
1. Take the Phred quality score **Q** (an integer).
2. Add **33** to it.
3. Convert the resulting number into its corresponding **ASCII character**.

This allows each quality score to be represented by a single printable character in the FASTQ file.

### 🧩 Python Functions for Conversion

```python
def QtoPhred33(Q):
    """Turn Q into Phred+33 ASCII-encoded quality"""
    return chr(Q + 33)
Converts an integer quality score (Q) into its ASCII character form.
chr() converts an integer to its ASCII character.
Example:
Q = 40 → 40 + 33 = 73 → chr(73) → 'I'

```python
def phred33ToQ(qual):
    """Turn Phred+33 ASCII-encoded quality into Q"""
    return ord(qual) - 33

Converts a Phred+33 encoded character back to its integer quality score.
ord() converts a character to its ASCII integer value.
Example:
qual = 'I' → ord('I') = 73 → 73 - 33 = 40

Summary

Phred score (Q) indicates sequencing accuracy.

Phred+33 encoding allows quality values to be stored compactly as ASCII text.

chr() and ord() are inverse functions that translate between integers and characters.

### 🧮 Naive Exact Matching Algorithm
We compare `P` to every possible substring of `T` of the same length.

**Algorithm Steps:**
1. For each possible alignment (offset) of `P` in `T`:
   - Compare each character in `P` with the corresponding character in `T`.
2. If all characters match → record this offset as a **match**.
3. If any mismatch occurs → move to the next alignment.

This is known as the **naive exact matching** approach.

### 🧰 Python Implementation Outline
```python
def naive(P, T):
    occurrences = []
    for i in range(len(T) - len(P) + 1):  # all possible alignments
        match = True
        for j in range(len(P)):           # compare characters
            if T[i + j] != P[j]:
                match = False
                break
        if match:
            occurrences.append(i)
    return occurrences

⚙️ Computational Complexity

Let:

x = length(P)

y = length(T)

Number of alignments:
y - x + 1

Worst-case character comparisons:
x * (y - x + 1)
Occurs when every character matches (i.e., pattern perfectly aligns everywhere).

Best-case character comparisons:
y - x + 1
Occurs when the first character mismatches at every alignment.

💡 Examples

Worst case: pattern and text share identical or repetitive characters → every alignment requires full comparison.

Best case: pattern starts with a letter not present in the text → immediate mismatch each time.

Example text:

P = "word"
T = "there would have been a time for such a word"


→ Total comparisons: 46
(40 mismatches + 6 matches)

📈 Key Insights
Case	Description	Comparisons
Best	First character mismatches each time	y - x + 1
Worst	Every character matches	x * (y - x + 1)
Typical	Most comparisons close to the minimum in real data	Much closer to best case

🧩 Summary

The naive exact matching algorithm tests every possible alignment between a pattern and a text.

Despite its simplicity, it provides the foundation for more advanced pattern matching and read alignment algorithms used in genomics.

In most real cases, the algorithm performs closer to the best-case scenario rather than the worst-case.
