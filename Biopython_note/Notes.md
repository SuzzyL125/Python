## üß¨ Introduction to Sequence Reads in FASTQ Format

The **FASTQ** format is a standard text-based file format used to store both **biological sequence data** (usually DNA or RNA reads) and their corresponding **quality scores** generated by high-throughput sequencing platforms such as Illumina. Each read in a FASTQ file is represented by **four lines**:

1. **Header line** ‚Äî begins with `@`, followed by a sequence identifier and optional description.  
2. **Sequence line** ‚Äî contains the raw nucleotide sequence (e.g., A, T, G, C, or N).  
3. **Separator line** ‚Äî begins with a `+` symbol, and may optionally repeat the identifier from the header.  
4. **Quality score line** ‚Äî encodes the quality of each base in the sequence, using ASCII characters that represent Phred quality scores.

Each set of four lines corresponds to one read. The quality scores are crucial for downstream analyses because they indicate the confidence of each base call.

**Example:**
@SEQ_ID
GATTACA
+
IIIIIII

Here:
- `@SEQ_ID` is the identifier of the sequence read.  
- `GATTACA` is the nucleotide sequence.  
- `IIIIIII` represents the quality scores, where each ‚ÄúI‚Äù encodes a high Phred score (indicating high confidence).
